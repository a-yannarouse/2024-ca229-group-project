        <h1>Core Workout Routine</h1>
        <h2>Warm-up:</h2>
        <p>5-10 minutes of light cardio (jumping jacks, jogging in place, or brisk walking)</p>

        <h2>Core Workout Routine:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Plank:</strong> Hold for 30 seconds to 1 minute</li>
            <p>To perform a basic forearm plank, start by lying face down on the floor or a yoga mat, placing your forearms on the ground with elbows aligned below your shoulders and arms parallel to each other, about shoulder-width apart. Engage your core by pulling your belly button towards your spine, then push off the floor, raising up onto your toes and resting on your forearms, ensuring your body forms a straight line from head to heels without letting your hips sag or pike up, and maintain a neutral gaze.</p>
            <p>A plank primarily targets the core muscles, which include the rectus abdominis (front abs), transverse abdominis (deep core muscles), and the internal and external obliques (side of the torso). In addition to the core, planks also engage several other muscle groups throughout the body, making it a comprehensive exercise. Best for people who want toned and lean stomachs.</p>

            <li><strong>Russian Twists:</strong> 20 reps (10 twists on each side)</li>
            <p>To perform a Russian twist, sit on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat, leaning back slightly to create a V-shape with your torso and thighs. Hold your hands together in front of your chest, or for added intensity, hold a weight. Engage your core and lift your feet slightly off the ground, if possible, to balance on your sit bones. Twist your torso to the right, bringing your hands or the weight towards the floor beside you, then twist to the left, engaging your abdominal and oblique muscles with each rotation. Keep your movements controlled and steady, and continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.</p>
            <p>Russian twists primarily target the abdominal muscles, focusing on the obliques, which are the muscles on the sides of your abdomen, but they also engage the rectus abdominis (the front part of your abs) and the transverse abdominis (the deepest layer of abdominal muscles). Additionally, this exercise works the lower back, shoulders, and hip flexors, providing a comprehensive workout that improves core strength and rotational mobility. Best for people who want an hourglass body shape.</p>

            <p>To perform a leg raise, lie flat on your back on the floor or a mat with your legs straight out in front of you and your arms at your sides, palms down for stability. Engage your core by pressing your lower back into the floor, then slowly lift your legs off the ground to a 90-degree angle, keeping them straight and together. Pause briefly at the top, then slowly lower your legs back down without letting them touch the floor for the full set, maintaining control and keeping your abdominal muscles engaged throughout the movement.</p>
            <p>Leg raises primarily target the lower abdominal muscles, specifically the rectus abdominis, while also engaging the hip flexors and, to a lesser extent, the obliques, offering a focused workout that strengthens and tones the lower core, improves core stability, and enhances overall abdominal muscle definition. Best for people who want lean and muscular abs and stomach.</p>

            <p>To perform bicycle crunches, lie on your back with your knees bent and feet lifted off the ground, placing your hands behind your head without interlocking your fingers. Engage your core and lift your shoulder blades off the ground, then twist your body to bring your right elbow towards your left knee while straightening your right leg. Switch sides by bringing your left elbow towards your right knee while simultaneously straightening your left leg, mimicking a pedaling motion. Continue alternating sides in a fluid, controlled manner, ensuring you fully extend each leg and maintain a steady pace to effectively engage your abdominal and oblique muscles.</p>
            <p>Bicycle crunches target the rectus abdominis, the main abdominal muscle, and are especially effective at engaging the obliques, the muscles on the sides of the abdomen, providing a comprehensive core workout that also involves the hip flexors and promotes improved balance, coordination, and flexibility.

			<li><strong>Mountain Climbers:</strong> 30 seconds</li>
            <p>To perform mountain climbers, start in a high plank position with your hands placed directly under your shoulders, your body in a straight line from head to heels, and your feet together. Engage your core, then quickly draw your right knee towards your chest without lifting your hips too high. Quickly switch legs, extending your right leg back to the starting position while simultaneously drawing your left knee towards your chest. Continue alternating legs at a rapid pace, maintaining a strong plank position with your back flat and hips level throughout the exercise to effectively engage your core, shoulders, and legs.</p>
            <p>Mountain climbers target multiple muscle groups, including the core muscles for stabilization, specifically engaging the rectus abdominis and obliques, while also working the deltoids, chest, and triceps for upper body strength, the quads in the legs, and the hamstrings for dynamic movement, making it an effective full-body workout that improves cardiovascular fitness, agility, and muscular endurance.

			<p>To perform a side plank, start by lying on your side with your legs straight and feet stacked. Place your elbow directly under your shoulder to prop up your upper body, with your forearm perpendicular to your body on the ground for stability. Engage your core and lift your hips off the ground, forming a straight line from your head to your feet. Keep your other hand on your hip or extend it towards the ceiling for balance. Hold this position, keeping your hips elevated and your body in a straight line, then switch sides and repeat the exercise to ensure balanced strength and muscle engagement on both sides of your body.</p>
			<p>Side planks primarily target the oblique muscles on the sides of the abdomen, offering a focused workout that strengthens and tones these areas, but they also engage the entire core including the rectus abdominis and transverse abdominis, as well as the shoulders, glutes, and hips, promoting improved core stability, balance, and posture.

			<p>To perform the dead bug exercise, start by lying flat on your back on the floor or a mat, with your arms extended straight up towards the ceiling directly above your shoulders, and your legs raised with your knees bent at a 90-degree angle above your hips. Engage your core by pressing your lower back into the floor to eliminate any gap. Simultaneously lower your right arm behind your head and extend your left leg straight out, just above the floor, ensuring your lower back remains in contact with the floor throughout the movement. Return to the starting position and repeat the movement with the opposite arm and leg, alternating sides in a controlled manner to maintain core engagement and coordination throughout the exercise.</p>
			<p>The dead bug exercise targets the core muscles, specifically focusing on the rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, and the obliques, enhancing core stability, coordination, and strength, while also engaging the hip flexors and providing a gentle workout for the arms and legs, making it an effective exercise for improving overall core function and reducing the risk of back pain.</p>

        <h1>Upper Body Workout Routine</h1>
        <h2>Warm-up:</h2>
        <p>5-10 minutes of light warm-up arm exercises (windmills, stretch out the arms, alternate toe touching, pushups)</p>

		<h2>Upper Body Workout Routine:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bench Press:</strong> Do 10 both arms, 3 reps (use whatever weight you are comfortable with)</li>
            <p>To perform a bench press, lie flat on a bench, grip the barbell with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, lower it to your chest level, and then press it upwards until your arms are fully extended, ensuring to maintain a controlled motion throughout the exercise.</p>
            <p>The bench press primarily targets the pectoral muscles, while also engaging the triceps, shoulders (anterior deltoids), and to a lesser extent, the back muscles for stabilization. Best for people who want to gain muscle and have lean arms.</p>

            <p>To perform an overhead press, also known as a military press, start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart for stability. Grip a barbell or dumbbells with your hands just outside your shoulders, palms facing forward. Engage your core and slightly tuck your chin to create a straight line from your head to your pelvis. Press the weight upward in a controlled motion until your arms are fully extended above your head without locking your elbows. Keep your wrists strong and straight. Lower the weight back down to the starting position at shoulder level, ensuring the descent is controlled and the back remains neutral, avoiding excessive arching. It's crucial to maintain proper form to prevent injury and effectively target the intended muscles—primarily the deltoids, triceps, and to a lesser extent, the upper chest and core for stabilization. As with any exercise, the techniques and understanding of biomechanics evolve, so staying informed about best practices is recommended for optimal performance and safety.</p>
            <p>The overhead press primarily targets the deltoid muscles in the shoulders, while also engaging the triceps, upper chest (pectoralis major), and core muscles for stabilization throughout the movement. Best for people who want to gain muscle and have lean arms.</p>

As the dumbbells ascend, quickly rotate your wrists to catch the dumbbells at shoulder height in a front squat position, with your elbows pointing forward. Stand up straight to complete the movement, then lower the dumbbells back to the starting position in a controlled manner, preparing for the next repetition. This exercise combines elements of a squat, an explosive pull, and a catch, effectively targeting the lower body, core, shoulders, and arms.</p>
			<p>The dumbbell clean primarily targets the lower body muscles, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes, as well as the upper body, specifically the deltoids, trapezius, and forearms, while also engaging the core muscles for stabilization throughout the explosive movement, offering a comprehensive full-body workout. Best for people who want lean and muscular arms.</p>

			<li><strong>Pull Ups:</strong> 15 reps</li>
			<p>To perform a pull-up clean, this movement seems to blend the concept of a pull-up with an element of a "clean" motion, which is not a standard exercise and might be misunderstood. However, if we interpret this as performing a pull-up with an added motion to simulate a "clean," a plausible description might be: Begin by hanging from a pull-up bar with an overhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Pull yourself up explosively, aiming to bring your chest to the bar while keeping your body straight and core engaged. At the top of the movement, rather than simply lowering back down, you could add a motion to mimic the "clean" by quickly pulling your knees up towards your chest in a rapid, clean-like motion before extending your legs again as you lower yourself to the starting position in a controlled manner. This additional knee raise at the top could engage the core and mimic the explosive component of a clean. Remember, since this is not a standard exercise, it's crucial to focus on form and safety to prevent injury.</p>
			<p>A pull-up primarily targets the latissimus dorsi muscles in the back, as well as the biceps, trapezius, and forearm muscles, making it an effective exercise for developing upper body strength and muscle definition. Best for people who want lean and muscular arms.</p>

			<li><strong>Skull Crusher:</strong> 15 each arm, 3 reps (use whatever weight you are comfortable with)</li>
			<p>To perform a skull crusher, lie on your back on a bench with your feet flat on the ground. Hold a barbell or EZ curl bar with a close grip (hands about shoulder-width apart) directly above your chest, arms fully extended. Keeping your upper arms stationary, bend your elbows to slowly lower the weight towards your forehead. Stop just before the weight touches your forehead, then extend your arms back to the starting position by contracting your triceps. Ensure the movement is controlled, focusing on moving through the triceps without moving your upper arms to maximize effectiveness and minimize risk of injury.</p>
			<p>A skull crusher primarily targets the triceps muscles at the back of the upper arm, effectively isolating and strengthening this area for improved arm definition and strength. Best for people who want lean and muscular arms.</p>

        <h2>Cool Down:</h2>
        <p>5-10 minutes of stretching, focusing on the upper body muscles (Cross-Body Shoulder Stretch, Overhead Triceps and Shoulder Stretch, Biceps Stretch)</p>
		<li><strong>Cross-Body Shoulder Stretch:</strong> To perform a cross-body shoulder stretch, stand or sit upright and bring one arm across your body at about chest height. Use your other hand to gently pull the elbow of the stretched arm closer to your chest, ensuring you feel a stretch in the shoulder of the arm being pulled. Hold this position for 15-30 seconds, then switch arms and repeat to stretch the other shoulder.</li>

		<li><strong>Overhead Triceps and Shoulder Stretch:</strong> To perform an overhead triceps and shoulder stretch, raise one arm overhead, bend the elbow so that your hand reaches towards the opposite shoulder blade. With your other hand, gently press on the bent elbow, encouraging the hand farther down your back, aiming to deepen the stretch in your triceps and shoulder. Hold this position for 15-30 seconds, then switch arms to stretch the other side.</li>
